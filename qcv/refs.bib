  abstract = {AIM: Effective prevention of periodontitis requires addressing multiple modifiable health behaviours (MHBs). This study aimed to examine how MHBs interact and to identify the key behaviours that could serve as targets for intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed data from a large, population-based survey using questionnaires conducted in China during 2021-2023. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between self-reported periodontitis and multiple MHBs. Network analysis was applied to assess interrelationships among MHBs and identify central MHBs.
RESULTS: Among 85,483 participants, 12.8% reported periodontitis. Ten MHBs were associated with self-reported periodontitis. Ever smoking, ever drinking, unhealthy bedtime, frequent consumption of sugar-sweetened snacks and beverages, insufficient vegetable or fruit intake and toothbrushing less than twice daily were linked to higher prevalence, while insufficient physical activity, no daily flossing and absence of annual dental checkups were linked to lower prevalence. Network analysis identified ever smoking, ever drinking, toothbrushing frequency and dental checkups as the most central behaviours, with variations observed across different subgroups.
CONCLUSION: This study identified key MHBs and revealed differences in central behaviours across subgroups. Ever smoking, ever drinking, toothbrushing frequency and annual dental checkups may represent priority targets for tailored prevention strategies. Future research is warranted to inform integrated interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although guidelines stress the importance of early screening for individuals at high risk of lung cancer in China, there is a lack of data on risk-adapted starting ages for screening. This study aims to determine the appropriate starting age for lung cancer screening in China, considering various risk factors associated with the disease.
METHODS: The data used were from the Cancer Screening Program in urban China. A total of 413,725 eligible participants aged 40-74 years from eight cities in China were enrolled between 2013 and 2021. The outcomes of the study included lung cancer diagnosis and age at diagnosis. The risk-adapted starting age for screening was defined as the age at which individuals with varying levels of lung cancer risk reached a 10-year cumulative risk level similar to that of those aged 50 years in the general population.
RESULTS: Among the 413,725 individuals who participated in the study, 1607 were diagnosed with lung cancer with a median follow-up of 4.90 (3.01, 6.84) years. The participants were categorized into different risk groups based on their lung cancer risk scores, which were determined by various risk factors, such as gender, education level, body mass index, vegetable intake, smoking pack-years, and tea consumption. In the study, the optimal starting age for lung cancer screening was determined on the basis of an individual's risk level. Using the 10-year cumulative risk of lung cancer at age 50 years in the general population as a benchmark (0.59% [95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.63%]), the study revealed that individuals with high, medium, or low risk of lung cancer should start screening at ages 46, 48, or 54 years and older, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes the age at which lung cancer screening should begin on the basis of the principle of equal management and risk management. These findings have the potential to contribute to updates in the current screening guidelines.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have highlighted the importance of blood lipid levels in lung cancer. However, evidence of the association between remnant cholesterol and lung cancer remains scarce. This study aimed to investigate the association of remnant cholesterol with lung cancer morbidity and mortality and to evaluate their joint effects with C-reactive protein in women.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 198,154 women initially without cancer from the UK Biobank. Remnant cholesterol was calculated as non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol minus the measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Cox models were adopted to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs for the incidence of lung cancer. Data were collected between 2006 and 2022 and analyzed in 2025.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.80-13.90 years, 1,552 lung cancer cases and 1,074 related deaths were identified. Remnant cholesterol was positively associated with lung cancer morbidity and mortality in a linear manner, with respective hazard ratios (95% CIs) of 1.50 (1.23, 1.82) and 1.40 (1.11, 1.77) in Quartile 4. Compared with the low remnant cholesterol/low C-reactive protein group, the risk of incident lung cancer and lung cancer mortality increased by 115% and 102%, respectively, in the high remnant cholesterol/high C-reactive protein group. The cumulative risks of lung cancer by age 80 years were higher in the high remnant cholesterol/high C-reactive protein group than in the low remnant cholesterol/low C-reactive protein group (morbidity=3.64% vs 1.56%; mortality=1.97% vs 0.82%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study found linear and positive associations of remnant cholesterol with lung cancer morbidity and mortality among women. The combination of high remnant cholesterol and C-reactive protein conferred the highest relative and absolute risks. These findings highlighted the importance of considering the combination of remnant cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels for the primary prevention of lung cancer and selection of high-risk populations for lung cancer screening among women.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is prevalent in China, but many features of CRC patients remain to be better characterized. We aimed to describe the characteristics of clinical epidemiology in CRC patients in China and to evaluate the changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) before and after treatment.
METHODS: A hospital-based survey was conducted among CRC patients from 2020 to 2021, covering 14 cities in China. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, disease knowledge, medical service utilization, medical expenditure, and HRQOL before and after treatment were surveyed. The multivariable regressions and structural equation model (SEM) were used to assess the association between characteristics and HRQOL.
RESULTS: In the survey of 4589 patients, nearly 80% were diagnosed at an age older than 50, with 59.5% being men and 54.5% having rectal cancer. Approximately 35.2% were diagnosed at stage IV and 37.5% had metastases. Prior to diagnosis, only 2.6% of patients had a colonoscopy screening, with the primary barrier being unawareness. After treatment, there was a significant decline in the overall HRQOL scores (66.98 vs. 65.39, P < 0.001) and a significant association between patients' awareness of CRC treatment and higher HRQOL changes (beta: 0.98, 95% CI 0.39-1.57; P = 0.001). The SEM model showed good model fit, revealing that awareness of CRC treatment was significantly associated with changes in HRQOL (beta: 0.06, 95% CI 0.04-0.09; P = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted a low CRC screening rate in China, largely due to limited public awareness. After treatment, HRQOL declined, and treatment awareness was significantly associated with this change.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening has been proven to be effective in reducing lung cancer mortality, but the ensuing high false-positive and overdiagnosis rates shackle the effectiveness of lung cancer screening (LCS) in China. Nodule malignancy prediction models may be an applicable solution.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study to develop and internally validate the model using data from the ongoing Henan province Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC). From 2013 to 2021, 23,031 heavy smokers underwent baseline screening with LDCT; 2553 participants were diagnosed with pulmonary nodules. Detailed questionnaire, physical assessment and follow-up were completed for all participants. Multivariable Cox proportional risk regression models were used to identify and integrate key prognostic factors for the development of a nomogram model. Data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) were utilized for external validation.
RESULTS: A total of 111 lung cancer cases with a median follow-up duration of 3.7 years occurred in the Henan CanSPUC. Age, gender, physical activity, consumption of pickled food, history of silicosis or pneumoconiosis, nodule type, size, calcification, and pleural retraction sign were included into the model. The AUC was 0.855, 0.844, and 0.863 for the 1-, 3- and 5-year lung cancer risk in the training set, respectively. Compared with Mayo model, VA model, PKU model, and Brock model, the Henan CanSPUC model yield statistically better discriminatory performance (all P values < 0.05). The model calibrated well across the deciles of predicted risk in both the overall population and all subgroups. The model demonstrated good calibration and discrimination in the internal validation cohort, while the external validation cohort showed lower predictive performance, indicating that further external validation is needed.
CONCLUSIONS: The model developed and validated in this study may be used to estimate the probability of lung cancer in nodules detected at baseline LDCT, allowing more efficient risk-adapted follow-up in population-based LCS programs. However, further external validation in broader and more diverse populations is warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with non-smokers in China accounting for over 40% of cases. Despite the proven efficacy of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in early detection and reduction of lung cancer mortality, the current paradigm of lung cancer screening, heavily focused on smoking status and age, may inadequately address the unique risk factors associated with non-smokers, particularly those with a family history of the disease. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening for non-smokers with a first-degree relative (FDR) history of lung cancer, a group at particularly high-risk.
METHODS: We developed a state-transition Markov model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 16 screening strategies for a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 non-smoking individuals aged 50 with a FDR history of lung cancer, considering various starting ages (50, 55, 60, 65 years) and intervals (one-off, annual, biennial, triennial). The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at three times China's 2022 per-capita GDP. Sensitivity analyses, scenario analyses and subgroup analysis by sex, were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared to no screening, all strategies except one-off screening at age 50, were cost-effective for both sexes. Biennial LDCT starting at age 55 was found to be most effective, with an ICER of CNY 68,932/QALY for males, and CNY 80,056/QALY for females. This cost-effectiveness probability for this strategy was approximately 90% for both sexes. Sensitivity analyses indicated that annual screening at age 55 was optimal without discounting. For males, biennial at age 60 was optimal if the FDR-related odds ratio for lung cancer incidence was below 1.492. Triennial screening at age 55 was optimal for females at full adherence. Ignoring disutility from false-positive results, annual at age 55 was optimal for both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: LDCT screening for non-smokers with a FDR history of lung cancer is cost-effective, especially biennial screening at 55. These findings support the development of more inclusive screening guidelines, which could enhance early detection and reduce mortality rates.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand the current status and changing trends in the lifetime risk of residents in Henan Province, China to develop and die from cancer.
METHODS: Lifetime risk was estimated using the Adjusted for Multiple Primaries (AMP) method, incorporating cancer incidence, mortality, and all-cause mortality data from 55 cancer registries in Henan Province, China. Estimates were calculated overall and stratified by gender and area. The annual percent change (APC) in lifetime risk from 2010 to 2020, stratified by gender and cancer site, was estimated using a log-linear model.
RESULTS: In 2020, the lifetime risk of developing and dying from cancer was 30.19 % (95 % CI: 29.63 %-30.76 %) and 23.62 % (95 % CI: 23.28 %-23.95 %), respectively. These estimates were higher in men, with values of 31.22 % (95 % CI: 30.59 %-31.85 %) for developing cancer and 26.73 % (95 % CI: 26.29 %-27.16 %) for dying from cancer, compared with women, who had values of 29.02 % (95 % CI: 28.12 %-29.91 %) and 20.08 % (95 % CI: 19.51 %-20.64 %), respectively. There were also geographical differences, with higher estimates in urban areas compared with rural areas. Residents had the highest lifetime risk of developing lung cancer, with a rate of 6.94 %, followed by breast cancer (4.14 %), stomach cancer (3.95 %), esophageal cancer (3.75 %), and liver cancer (2.86 %). Similarly, the highest lifetime risk of dying from cancer was observed for the following sites: lung (5.99 %), stomach (3.60 %), esophagus (3.39 %), liver (2.78 %), and colorectum (1.55 %). Overall, the lifetime risk of developing cancer increased, with an APC of 0.75 % (P < 0.05). Varying trends were observed across different cancer sites. There were gradual decreases in nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, and liver cancers. Conversely, increasing trends were noted for most other sites, with the highest APCs observed in thyroid, prostate, lymphoma, kidney, and gallbladder cancers.
CONCLUSION: The lifetime risks of developing and dying from cancer were 30.19 % and 23.62 %, respectively. Variations in cancer risk across different regions, genders, specific cancer sites, and over calendar years provide important information for cancer prevention and policy making in the population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This review examines global human genetic resources management, focusing on genetic data policies and repositories in high- and middle-low-income countries.
METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy was employed across multiple databases, including official government websites and Google, to gather relevant literature on human genetic resources management policies and genetic resource databases. Documents were screened for relevance, focusing on high-income countries (United States, United Kingdom, Japan) and middle-low-income countries (China, India, Kenya). Data were extracted, coded, and analyzed to identify common themes and differences in genetic resource management practices.
RESULTS: High-income countries benefit from robust legal frameworks and advanced technological infrastructures. The United States enforces the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to protect privacy and facilitate data sharing, while Japan relies on the Act on the Protection of Personal Information and ethical guidelines. Additionally, high-income countries host a variety of genetic databases and biobanks that support scientific research. In contrast, middle-low-income countries like China, India, and Kenya are still developing their frameworks. China has regulations such as the Biosecurity Law and the Regulations on the Management of Human Genetic Resources, but still requires more unified standards. India's policies focus on genetic research and data protection through the Biological Diversity Act, while Kenya seeks to improve data management through the 2019 Data Protection Act.
CONCLUSION: Significant disparities exist in human genetic resources management between high-income and middle-low-income countries. High-income countries have robust systems balancing privacy protection with research facilitation, supported by comprehensive and large-scale databases for scientific research. Middle-low-income countries need to enhance legal frameworks and build population-specific databases. Promoting equitable data sharing and adopting best practices from high-income countries are essential for advancing global scientific discovery and ensuring fair management of genetic resources.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: There is a notable absence of robust evidence on the efficacy of ultrasound-based breast cancer screening strategies, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of dense breasts. Our study addresses this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of such strategies in Chinese women, thereby enriching the evidence base for identifying the most efficacious screening approaches for women with dense breast tissue.
METHODS: Conducted from October 2018 to August 2022 in Central China, this prospective cohort study enrolled 8996 women aged 35-64 years, divided into two age groups (35-44 and 45-64 years). Participants were screened for breast cancer using hand-held ultrasound (HHUS) and automated breast ultrasound system (ABUS), with the older age group also receiving full-field digital mammography (FFDM). The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) was employed for image interpretation, with abnormal results indicated by BI-RADS 4/5, necessitating a biopsy; BI-RADS 3 required follow-up within 6-12 months by primary screening strategies; and BI-RADS 1/2 were classified as negative.
RESULTS: Among the screened women, 29 cases of breast cancer were identified, with 4 (1.3‰) in the 35-44 years age group and 25 (4.2‰) in the 45-64 years age group. In the younger age group, HHUS and ABUS performed equally well, with no significant difference in their AUC values (0.8678 vs. 0.8679, P > 0.05). For the older age group, ABUS as a standalone strategy (AUC 0.9935) and both supplemental screening methods (HHUS with FFDM, AUC 0.9920; ABUS with FFDM, AUC 0.9928) outperformed FFDM alone (AUC 0.8983, P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between HHUS alone and FFDM alone (AUC 0.9529 vs. 0.8983, P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that both HHUS and ABUS exhibit strong performance as independent breast cancer screening strategies, with ABUS demonstrating superior potential. However, the integration of FFDM with these ultrasound techniques did not confer a substantial improvement in the overall effectiveness of the screening process.},

While evidence indicates MPs can accumulate in closed human organs like the heart, placenta, and blood, there is no available data on MP exposure specifically within the human bone marrow. To fill the research gap, this study detected the concentration of microplastics (MPs) in bone marrow samples by pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and assessed the size range and morphological characteristics of MPs by Laser Direct Infrared Spectroscopy (LD-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our study shows that MPs were present in all 16 bone marrow samples, with an average concentration of 51.29 µg/g ranging from 15.37 µg/g to 92.05 µg/g. Five polymer types-polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyadiohexylenediamine 66 (PA66), and polypropylene (PP), were identified. PE was the most frequent polymer detected in the bone marrow, with an average concentration of 30.02 µg/g ranging from 14.77 µg/g to 52.57 µg/g, with a detection rate of 93.75 %. PS had the highest detection rate at 100 % of bone marrow samples, while PVC and PA66 were found in 75 % of samples each. LD-IR analysis revealed the identification of 25 polymer types, with an average abundance of 19.72 particles/g. Of these, 89.82 % of the MPs were smaller than 100 µm. In summary, this study has, for the first time, demonstrated the presence of MPs are deeply embedded within human bone marrow, providing a basis for future investigations into their potential toxicological effects and underlying mechanisms affecting the hematopoietic system.},

We aimed to investigate the association between combined healthy lifestyle factors and risk of depressive symptoms.
METHODS: We conducted a baseline survey from July 2021 to December 2023, including 53,642 Chinese adults from general population. A healthy lifestyle score was constructed based on six lifestyle factors (physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, diet, sleep duration, and body mass index). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for confounding variables.
RESULTS: Each additional healthy lifestyle score was associated with a 20 % lower risk of having depressive symptoms (OR (95 % CI): 0.80 (0.78-0.81)). Compared with individuals with ≤2 healthy lifestyle factors, individuals with all the six healthy lifestyle factors had a 58 % reduced risk of having depressive symptoms (0.42 (0.37-0.47)). After stratification by gender, education and urbanization, the significant inverse association with healthy lifestyle score was stronger in women, individuals with high education, and urban residents. Besides, the significant negative association between healthy lifestyle score and depressive symptoms remained for different severity of depressive symptoms.
LIMITATIONS: Given the cross-sectional nature of data, we cannot make causal inferences.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that adherence to healthy lifestyle factors was associated with a reduced risk of having depressive symptoms among Chinese adults. The observed associations were modified by gender, education and urbanization. These findings warrant further verification in interventional studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Annual screening through low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is recommended for heavy smokers. However, it is questionable whether all individuals require annual screening given the potential harms of LDCT screening. This study examines the benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness of risk-based screening in heavy smokers and determines the optimal risk threshold for screening and risk-stratified screening intervals.
METHODS: We conducted a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis in China, using a cohort-based Markov model which simulated a lung cancer screening cohort of 19,146 heavy smokers aged 50 ~ 74 years old, who had a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years and were either current smokers or had quit for < 15 years. A total of 34 risk-based screening strategies, varying by different risk groups for screening eligibility and screening intervals (1-year, 2-year, 3-year, one-off, non-screening), were evaluated and were compared with annual screening for all heavy smokers (the status quo strategy). The analysis was undertaken from the health service perspective with a 30-year time horizon. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was adopted as three times the gross domestic product (GDP) of China in 2021 (CNY 242,928) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Compared with the status quo strategy, nine risk-based screening strategies were found to be cost-effective, with two of them even resulting in cost-saving. The most cost-effective strategy was the risk-based approach of annual screening for individuals with a 5-year risk threshold of ≥ 1.70%, biennial screening for individuals with a 5-year risk threshold of 1.03 ~ 1.69%, and triennial screening for individuals with a 5-year risk threshold of < 1.03%. This strategy had the highest incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB) of CNY 1032. All risk-based screening strategies were more efficient than the status quo strategy, requiring 129 ~ 656 fewer screenings per lung cancer death avoided, and 0.5 ~ 28 fewer screenings per life-year gained. The cost-effectiveness of risk-based screening was further improved when individual adherence to screening improved and individuals quit smoking after being screened.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk-based screening strategies are more efficient in reducing lung cancer deaths and gaining life years compared to the status quo strategy. Risk-stratified screening intervals can potentially balance long-term benefit-harm trade-offs and improve the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screenings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is believed that smoking is not the cause of approximately 53% of lung cancers diagnosed in women globally.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to develop and validate a simple and noninvasive model that could assess and stratify lung cancer risk in nonsmoking Chinese women.
METHODS: Based on the population-based Cancer Screening Program in Urban China, this retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study was carried out with a vast population base and an immense number of participants. The training set and the validation set were both constructed using a random distribution of the data. Following the identification of associated risk factors by multivariable Cox regression analysis, a predictive nomogram was developed. Discrimination (area under the curve) and calibration were further performed to assess the validation of risk prediction nomogram in the training set, which was then validated in the validation set.
RESULTS: In sum, 151,834 individuals signed up to take part in the survey. Both the training set (n=75,917) and the validation set (n=75,917) were comprised of randomly selected participants. Potential predictors for lung cancer included age, history of chronic respiratory disease, first-degree family history of lung cancer, menopause, and history of benign breast disease. We displayed 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year lung cancer risk-predicting nomograms using these 5 factors. In the training set, the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year lung cancer risk areas under the curve were 0.762, 0.718, and 0.703, respectively. In the validation set, the model showed a moderate predictive discrimination.
CONCLUSIONS: We designed and validated a simple and noninvasive lung cancer risk model for nonsmoking women. This model can be applied to identify and triage people at high risk for developing lung cancers among nonsmoking women.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A cluster randomized controlled trial of endoscopy-based screening for esophageal cancer (EC) and gastric cancer (GC) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of this strategy in a non-high-incidence rural area of China. The trial design and baseline findings are presented here.
METHODS: A total of 33 eligible villages in Luoshan County in Henan Province were assigned randomly to the intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio by a computer-generated randomization list. Local residents aged 40 to 69 years were enrolled from the villages. Participants in the intervention group were risk-stratified with a questionnaire, and high-risk individuals were subsequently screened by endoscopy. The primary outcomes were EC and GC mortality. The secondary outcomes comprised the detection rate, stage distribution, and the treatment rate. In this study, baseline characteristics were assessed by a questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore factors associated with endoscopy compliance.
RESULTS: Trial recruitment was completed in 2017, and ultimately, there were 12,475 and 11,442 participants allocated to the intervention (17 clusters) and the control group (16 clusters), respectively. We included 23,653 participants in the analysis, with 12,402 in the intervention group and 11,251 in the control group. A total of 6,286 (50.7%) participants in the intervention group were estimated as high-risk individuals, and 2,719 (43.3%) underwent endoscopy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that some factors including age, gender, education, personality and mental health, and upper gastrointestinal diseases or symptoms might affect endoscopy compliance. The detection rates for positive cases of EC and GC were 0.22% and 0.55%, respectively. The rates for esophageal and gastric precancerous lesions were 0.70% and 2.35%, respectively. The early detection rates for EC and GC were 50.0% and 33.3%, respectively. Additionally, the overall treatment rate for positive cases was 90.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic yield of endoscopy-based screening for EC and GC was relatively low in a non-high-incidence rural area. The study may offer clues for the improvement of endoscopy compliance and the optimization of screening strategies for upper gastrointestinal cancer in non-high-incidence areas.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic screening program was carried out in Henan Province, China to reduce the large gastric cancer burden, and its effect evidence is insufficient. Knowledge on current status and time-trend of gastric cancer is need for policy makers to optimize the strategy of gastric cancer control.
METHODS: Gastric cancer data were pooled from registries in the Henan Cancer Registration System which may reflect the whole province cancer incidence and mortality. The pooled registration data, stratified by area (urban/rural), gender, and age groups, was combined with the provincial population data to estimate the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer in Henan Province. The Segi's world standard population was applied to calculate the age-standardized rate. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze the time-trend in the incidence and mortality.
RESULTS: Gastric cancer was diagnosed in 33,971 patients in 2018, ranking second among all cancers. The crude incidence and age-standardized incidence rate (ASIRW) per 100,000 population were 31.15 and 23.05, respectively. In 2018, there were an estimated 25,921 gastric cancer-related deaths, ranking second among all cancer-related deaths. The crude mortality rate and age-standardized mortality rate by world standard population (ASMRW) were respectively 23.77 and 16.80 per 100,000 population. Gender and geographical differences were observed. Notably, the ASIRW and ASMRW were higher in males than females and higher in rural areas than urban areas. For ASIRW and ASMRW, the male to female ratio was 2.50 and 2.71, respectively, and the rural to urban ratio was 1.23 and 1.24, respectively. Declines in the incidence [average annual percent change (AAPC): -3.9%, P=0.001] and mortality (AAPC: -3.1%, P=0.004) of gastric cancer were observed in rural areas due to declines in the incidence and mortality among residents aged 40-69 years. The overall trend of ASIRW and ASMRW were observed to decline with AAPCs of -3.5% (P=0.003) and -2.8% (P=0.007), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Gastric cancer incidence and mortality decreased in Henan Province, China, from 2010 to 2018, which may due to the implementation of endoscopic screening for gastric cancer in rural areas. The disease burden, however, remains high, and screening strategies and measures to reduce it should be strengthened.},

METHODS: The qualified data was obtained from the Henan Provincial Central Cancer Registry of China, covering 30.51% of the whole population. Incidence, mortality, proportions, and cumulative rates (among patients aged 0-74 years old) of lung cancer by areas, sex and age groups were estimated. The world Segi's standard population was applied to calculate the age-standardized rate. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) to evaluate temporal trends from 2010 to 2018.
RESULTS: In 2018, there were about 55,344 new cases of lung cancer in Henan province, with the crude incidence of 50.75/100,000, the age-standardized incidence rate by world standard (Segi's) population (ASIRW) of 37.14/100,000, and the cumulative rate of 4.57%. About 41,782 people died from lung cancer in 2018, with the crude mortality rate of 38.31/100,000, the age-standardized mortality rate by world standard (Segi's) population (ASMRW) of 27.09/100,000, and the cumulative rate of 3.22%. The age-specific incidence and mortality of lung cancer increased gradually as age increased and reached the peak at the age of 85+ years. The overall ASIRW (AAPC =0.3, P=0.531) and ASMRW (AAPC =-0.2, P=0.687) remained stable from 2010 to 2018, but decreased in urban areas from 2014 to 2018 (APC for ASIRW =-4.7, P=0.023; APC for ASMRW =-5.3, P=0.012). From 2010 to 2018, the incidence rate increased in the rural population aged 75+ years old (AAPC =4.2, P=0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer significantly decreased in urban areas partly due to the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China. Nonetheless, the disease burden remains high, especially in males and elderly population. Comprehensive prevention and control programs, such as smoking cessation intervention, screening, early diagnosis and early treatment programs, need to be implemented to reduce the burden of lung cancer.},

As one of world-renowned high-risk areas, the epidemiology of EC in Henan has not been recently updated. Therefore, we aimed to depict the status quo of EC and analyze its time-trend in Henan.
METHODS: The EC data were extracted from the Henan Provincial Cancer registry database derived from the population based cancer registry system, which covered 30.51% of the whole population in Henan and were qualified according to national and international guidelines. The incidence and mortality of EC were estimated by area (rural/urban), gender, and age groups. The age-standardized rates (ASRs) were calculated according to the Segi's population. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) to evaluate the time-trend of EC.
RESULTS: As estimated, there were 29,913 new EC cases in Henan, 2018. The crude incidence and the age-standardized incidence rate by world standard population (ASIRW) was 27.43/105 and 19.96/105, respectively. The incidence in males and rural was 1.83 and 1.51 times higher than that in females and urban areas, respectively. Meanwhile, it was estimated that 22,688 deaths occurred in 2018. The crude mortality and the age-standardized mortality rate by world standard population (ASMRW) were 20.80/105 and 14.47/105, respectively. Similarly, males and rural areas had higher mortality compared with females and urban areas. The age-specific incidence and mortality of EC showed significant increasing after 60-64 years group. In general, the time-trend of incidence (APC: -8.9, P<0.001) and mortality (APC: -7.6, P<0.001) of EC showed a significant decreasing trend since 2014, and downward trend were also observed in rural areas for incidence (APC: -5.2, P<0.001) and mortality (APC: -3.9, P<0.001) from 2010 to 2018.
CONCLUSIONS: The EC incidence and mortality in Henan has exhibited a significant declining trend in past years. Nonetheless, the disease burden remains high, especially in males and rural areas. Therefore, the ongoing prevention and control strategies of EC should be maintained alongside the establishment of more effective strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Henan province is an area with a serious disease burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) in China. Understanding the current incidence and mortality and the time-trend is critical to formulate and optimize prevention and control strategies for CRC. However, the current incidence and mortality and time-trend of CRC in Henan province, China have not been reported.
METHODS: CRC data was got from the Henan Provincial Central Cancer Registry of China in which the data was submitted from local cancer registries. Combined with the census data, the incidence, mortality, proportion, age-standardized rate by Chinese population (ASRC), age-standardized rate by world population (ASRW), and cumulative incidence and mortality (0-74 years old) of CRC by urban and rural population, gender, and age groups were estimated. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of ASRC from 2010 to 2017 were analyzed.
RESULTS: In 2017, it was estimated that there were 20,275 new cases and 10,046 deaths of CRC in Henan province. The crude incidence was 18.73/100,000, with an age-standardized incidence rate by Chinese population (ASIRC) of 13.97/100,000 and age-standardized mortality rate by world population (ASIRW) of 13.78/100,000. The cumulative incidence was 1.66%. The mortality rate was 9.28/100,000, with an age-standardized mortality rate by Chinese population (ASMRC) of 6.49/100,000 and an age-standardized mortality rate by world population (ASMRW) of 6.45/100,000. The cumulative mortality rate was 0.69%. The ASIRC and ASMRC were higher in urban areas (15.89/100,000, 7.19/100,000) than in rural areas (13.13/100,000, 6.20/100,000), and higher in males (15.53/100,000, 7.44/100,000) than in females (12.48/100,000, 5.66/100,000). The age-specific incidence reached the peak at age of 80-84, and the age-specific mortality reached the peak at age 85. From 2010 to 2017, the overall ASIRC and ASMRC showed a steady trend (P>0.05), while an upward trend was observed in the mortality rate in urban males (AAPC =3.4, 95% CI: 0.2-6.7, P=0.040).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and mortality of CRC were high in Henan province, and higher in urban areas and males. It is critical to strengthen the prevention and control of CRC, carry out targeted intervention, and promote screening and early diagnosis and treatment, particularly among urban areas and males.},

We aimed to develop and validate a simple and non-invasive tool for triaging cirrhosis risk in at-risk alcohol drinkers without HBV/HCV infection. A large-sample size, cross-sectional study within the framework of a population-based Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC) was conducted. Data on the liver cancer screening in Henan province, China were used. At-risk alcohol drinkers were those who currently drink one or more alcohol units per week for at least six months. A total of 6,581 eligible participants enrolled from October 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016 were included into the derivation dataset, and 2,096 eligible participants enrolled from January 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018 were included into the external validation dataset, respectively. Using the derivation dataset, a 20-point scale risk score model was developed, based on sex, education background, dietary intake of vegetables, dietary intake of roughage, smoking index, length of secondhand smoke exposure, history of fatty liver, history of diabetes, and first-degree family history of liver cancer. The model showed excellent discrimination (AUC  =  0.787; 95% CI, 0.7603-0.812) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test: P = 0.123) in the derivation dataset and an optimal cut-off value of 12 yield sensitivity of 61.3%, specificity of 82.7%. The model also had achieved similar performance in the external validation dataset. In conclusion, this model can be a practical tool to identify and triage population at high risk of cirrhosis in at-risk alcohol drinkers without HBV/HCV infection.
PREVENTION RELEVANCE: The risk model we developed will not only be used as a practical tool to triage high risk groups for liver cirrhosis, but also have implications for public health measures, such as guidelines for the prevention of liver cancer, in at-risk alcohol drinkers without HBV/HCV infection.},

The analysis was conducted using data from the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC), which recruited 282 377 participants aged 40 to 74 years from eight cities in the Henan province. Using the CanSPUC risk score system, 55 428 participants were evaluated to have high risk for lung cancer and were recommended for LDCT. We calculated the overall and group-specific participation rates using family history of common cancers and compared differences in participation rates between different groups. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were derived by multivariable logistic regression. Of the 55 428 participants, 22 260 underwent LDCT (participation rate, 40.16%). Family history of lung, esophageal, stomach, liver and colorectal cancer was associated with increased participation in LDCT screening. The odds of participants with a family history of one, two, three and four or more cancer cases undergoing LDCT screening were 1.9, 2.7, 2.8 and 3.5 times, respectively, than those without a family history of cancer. Compared to those without a history of cancer, participation in LDCT gradually increased as the number of cancer cases in the family increased (P < .001). Our findings suggest that there is room for improvement in lung cancer screening given the relatively low participation rate. Lung cancer screening in populations with a family history of cancer may improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness; however, this requires further verification.},

RESULTS: A total of 214,764 eligible subjects were included, with a mean age of 55.19 years. Subjects were randomly divided into the training (107,382) and validation (107,382) sets. Elder age, being male, a low education level, family history of lung cancer, history of tuberculosis, and without a history of hyperlipidemia were the independent risk factors for lung cancer. Using these six variables, we plotted 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year lung cancer risk prediction nomogram. The AUC was 0.753, 0.752, and 0.755 for the 1-, 3- and 5-year lung cancer risk in the training set, respectively. In the validation set, the model showed a moderate predictive discrimination, with the AUC was 0.668, 0.678, and 0.685 for the 1-, 3- and 5-year lung cancer risk.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a simple and non-invasive lung cancer risk model in non-smokers. This model can be applied to identify and triage patients at high risk for developing lung cancers in non-smokers.},

  abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a cartilage degenerative disease commonly observed in the elderly population and is pathologically characterized by the degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTSs) are critical enzymes involved in the degradation of ECM. Olmesartan is an inhibitor of the angiotensin II receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension, and recent studies show that it exerts anti-inflammatory effects in arthritis. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the protective effect of Olmesartan on cartilage ECM degradation. Interleukin-29 (IL-29) is a novel inflammatory mediator involved in the inflammation and degradation of cartilage in OA, and human T/C-28a2 cells treated with it were the inflammatory model in vitro. We found that the degradation of type 2 collagens and aggrecans was induced by IL-29, accompanied by the upregulation of MMPs and ADAMTSs, but the presence of Olmesartan significantly ameliorated these increases. In addition, Olmesartan abolished IL-29- induced oxidative stress and elevated the expression level of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6). Mechanistically, we showed that Olmesartan suppressed IL-29- caused inhibitor kappa B α (IκBα) expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) p65, indicating it suppressed the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Collectively, our data reveal that Olmesartan exerted a protective function on IL-29- induced type 2 collagen degradation in human chondrocytes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduces lung cancer mortality. Risk-prediction models have been proved to select individuals for lung cancer screening effectively. With the focus on established risk factors for lung cancer routinely available in general cancer screening settings, we aimed to develop and internally validated a risk prediction model for lung cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC) in Henan province, China between 2013 and 2019, we conducted a prospective cohort study consisting of 282,254 participants including 126,445 males and 155,809 females. Detailed questionnaire, physical assessment and follow-up were completed for all participants. Using Cox proportional risk regression analysis, we developed the Henan Lung Cancer Risk Models based on simplified questionnaire. Model discrimination was evaluated by concordance statistics (C-statistics), and model calibration was evaluated by the bootstrap sampling, respectively.
RESULTS: By 2020, a total of 589 lung cancer cases occurred in the follow-up yielding an incident density of 64.91/100,000 person-years (pyrs). Age, gender, smoking, history of tuberculosis and history of emphysema were included into the model. The C-index of the model for 1-year lung cancer risk was 0.766 and 0.741 in the training set and validation set, respectively. In stratified analysis, the model showed better predictive power in males, younger participants, and former or current smoking participants. The model calibrated well across the deciles of predicted risk in both the overall population and all subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and internally validated a simple risk prediction model for lung cancer, which may be useful to identify high-risk individuals for more intensive screening for cancer prevention.},

  abstract = {Identification of high-risk population among hepatitis B virus (HBV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals with first-degree relatives (FDR) who have liver cancer is important to implement precise intervention. A cross-sectional study was conducted under the framework of a population-based Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC), aimed to develop and validate a simple noninvasive model that could assess and stratify cirrhosis risk, in HBV/HCV-infected individuals with FDRs who have liver cancer. People who participated in liver cancer screening in Henan province were enrolled. Using the data set consisting of participants admitted from October 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016, a 24-point scale risk score model was developed through logistic regression, based on educational background, dietary habit, smoking index, cooking oil fume exposure, history of severe trauma, HBV/HCV infection status, history of diabetes, history of hyperlipidemia, and parent history of liver cancer. The model showed excellent discrimination with area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.875 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.853-0.896] and fair calibration with a Hosmer-Lemeshow test P = 0.106. The prevalence rates in the medium- and high-risk groups were 2.87 (95% CI, 1.94-4.25) and 47.57 (95% CI, 31.59-71.63) times of low-risk group, respectively. After internal validation, bias-corrected AUROC was 0.874 (95% CI, 0.873-0.875). In the external validation data set consisting of participants admitted from January 1, 2017, to October 31, 2018, the model had achieved similar discrimination, calibration, and risk stratification ability. In conclusion, the risk score model we developed can be a practical tool for the screening and prevention of liver cirrhosis among HBV/HCV-infected individuals with FDRs who have liver cancer. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: We created a simple and noninvasive cirrhosis risk model for individuals infected by HBV/HCV who have FDRs with liver cancer. This model is useful not only for the prognosis of HBV/HCV infection, but also for the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the participation rate and detection rate of lung cancer in a population-based screening program and the factors associated with participation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China from October 2013 to October 2019, with follow-up until March 10, 2020. The program is conducted at centers in 8 cities in Henan Province, China. Eligible participants were aged 40 to 74 and were evaluated for a high risk for lung cancer using an established risk score system.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall and group-specific participation rates by common factors, such as age, sex, and educational level, were calculated. Differences in participation rates between those groups were compared. The diagnostic yield of both screening and nonscreening groups was calculated.
RESULTS: The study recruited 282 377 eligible participants and included 55 428 with high risk for lung cancer; the mean (SD) age was 55.3 (8.1) years, and 34 966 participants (63.1%) were men. A total of 22 260 participants underwent LDCT (participation rate, 40.16%; 95% CI, 39.82%-40.50%). The multivariable logistic regression model showed that female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% CI, 1.52-1.78), former smoking (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.13-1.41), lack of physical activity (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.14-1.24), family history of lung cancer (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.66-1.79), and 7 other factors were associated with increased participation of LDCT screening. Overall, at 6-year follow-up, 78 participants in the screening group (0.35%; 95% CI, 0.29%-0.42%) and 125 in the nonscreening group (0.38%; 95% CI, 0.33%-0.44%) had lung cancer detected, which resulted in an odds ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.70-1.23; P = .61).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The low participations rate in the program studied suggests that an improved strategy is needed. These findings may provide useful information for designing effective population-based lung cancer screening strategies in the future.},

A hospital-based study was conducted with mRNA, DNA, and liquid-based cytology (LBC) as primary screening tests. Each woman with a positive result received colposcopy with lesion-targeted-biopsy. Histopathological diagnosis was used as the gold standard. The total agreement of HPV DNA and mRNA was 90.7% (95%CI: 87.9, 92.9) with a kappa value of 0.81. The positive rates of HPV DNA, mRNA, and LBC increased with the severity of histopathology diagnosis, from 25.5, 19.1, and 11.4% in normal to 100.0% in SCC, respectively. The sensitivities for mRNA to detect CIN2+ and CIN3+ were 93.8% (95%CI: 89.7-96.4) and 95.7% (95%CI: 91.3-97.9), respectively, which were not different from HPV DNA testing (95.7% [95%CI: 92.0-97.7], 96.3% [95%CI: 92.1-98.3]), but higher than LBC (80.4% [95%CI: 74.5-85.2] and 88.8% [95%CI: 83.0-92.8]). The specificities for mRNA to detect CIN2+ (79.0% [95%CI: 74.2-83.0]) and CIN3+ (70.5% [95%CI: 65.7-74.9]) were higher than HPV DNA testing (71.0% [95%CI: 65.9-75.7], 62.8% [95%CI: 57.8-67.5]), but lower than LBC (84.5% [95%CI: 80.1-88.0] 79.8% [95%CI: 75.4-83.6]). All tests were more effective in women older than 30 years. HPV mRNA test showed excellent agreement with the DNA test, with similar sensitivity and a higher specificity in detecting high-grade cervical lesions. It is promising that mRNA test could be used for the national cervical cancer screening to reduce false positive without losing sensitivity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of modifiable dietary factors, which are involved in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), could inform strategies to prevent GDM.
METHODS: We examined the dietary patterns in a Chinese population and evaluated their relationship with GDM risk using a case-control study including 1,464 cases and 8,092 control subjects. Propensity score matching was used to reduce the imbalance of covariates between cases and controls. Dietary patterns were identified using factor analysis while their associations with GDM risk were evaluated using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: A "vegetable" dietary pattern was characterized as the consumption of green leafy vegetables (Chinese little greens and bean seedling), other vegetables (cabbages, carrots, tomatoes, eggplants, potatoes, mushrooms, peppers, bamboo shoots, agarics, and garlic), and bean products (soybean milk, tofu, kidney beans, and cowpea). For every quartile increase in the vegetables factor score during 1 year prior to conception, the first trimester, and the second trimester of pregnancy, the GDM risk lowered by 6% (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 0.99), 7% (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.99), and 9% (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.96).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study suggests that the vegetable dietary pattern is associated with lower GDM risk; however, the interpretation of the result should with caution due to the limitations in our study, and additional studies are necessary to explore the underlying mechanism of this relationship.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the health systems of many countries worldwide. Several studies have suggested that the pandemic affects not only physical health but also all aspects of society. A lot of information has been reported about the disease since the beginning of the outbreak. For that reason, it is essential to investigate the attitudes and level of knowledge and awareness that different populations had regarding COVID-19 during the critical period of the outbreak.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and awareness of and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic among different populations in Central China during the critical period of the outbreak.
METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in Central China from February to March 2020. The study participants included three different populations: medical workers, students, and those with other occupations. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to collect information on the following four aspects: sociodemographic information, knowledge related to COVID-19, awareness of COVID-19, and attitude toward COVID-19. The chi-square test and Fisher test were used for comparison among groups. The level of significance was set at P<.05.
RESULTS: This study enrolled a total of 508 participants. Among them, there were 380 students (74.8%), 39 medical workers (7.7%), and 89 people with other occupations (17.5%). Most of the participants were female (n=272, 53.5%), lived in rural areas (n=258, 50.8%), and were single (n=423, 86.9%). The majority of the respondents had attended college (n=454, 89.4%). Most of the participants said they had heard about COVID-19 by January, and most of them looked for information on social media (Sina Weibo, 84.7%), and WeChat and QQ groups (74.2%). The participants showed an adequate level of knowledge about COVID-19 with no significant differences among the groups. However, medical workers demonstrated a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions such as the potential susceptible population, possible host, treatment of COVID-19, and disease category. A higher proportion of medical workers (71.8%) and those in the other occupations group (52.8%) were highly concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 43% of the participants stated that the lockdown of their village/city had a significant impact on their lives. Nevertheless, the majority of respondents had an overall optimistic attitude toward the control of the disease (92.1% of students [n=350], 94.9% of medical workers [n=37], and 92.3% of those in other occupations [n=83]).
CONCLUSIONS: All three groups reported an adequate background knowledge about COVID-19 but medical workers showed a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions. Most of the participants were highly concerned about COVID-19 during the critical period of the outbreak. The majority of respondents declared that the village/city lockdown policy had a significant impact on their daily life but most of them held an optimistic attitude toward the control of COVID-19.},

Therefore, the relative survival and cure fraction were estimated in our study.
METHODS: Population-based cancer registration data were used to estimate survival and cure fraction. A total of 7585 gastric cancer cases (ICD10:C16.0 ~ C16.9) were extracted and included in the final analysis. Cases were diagnosed in 2003-2012 and followed until the end of 2017. Relative survival was calculated as the ratio between the observed survival through the life-table method. The expected survival was estimated by the Ederer II method. The cure fraction was estimated using flexible parametric cure models stratified by age and calendar period when the cases were diagnosed.
RESULTS: The 5-year relative survival of cardia gastric cancer increased with the calendar period of 2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012 (27.5%, 28.3%, 33.5%, 38.2%, and 46.8%, respectively). The increasing trend along with the calendar periods was also observed in cure proportion of cardia gastric cancer (24.8%, 25.2%, 31.7%, 36.0%, and 43.1%, respectively). Notable improvement of cure proportion was observed in the period of 2011-2012, compared with the initial period of 2003-2004. There was an improvement of 79.8% among all gastric cancer subjects, and it was 74.1% and 55.7% in cardia gastric and noncardia gastric cancer subjects, respectively. The median survival of "uncured" patients showed no significant improvement along with the calendar periods in all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Notable improvement of gastric cancer relative survival and cure proportion was observed in Linzhou during 2003-2012.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Liver cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. We aimed to use the cancer registration data in 2015 to estimate the incidence and mortality of liver cancer in Henan province.
METHODS: The data from 37 population-based cancer registries in Henan province were collected for this study. The pooled data were stratified by area, sex, and age group. New cases of liver cancer and deaths due to the disease were estimated using age-specific rates and provincial population in 2015. All incidence and death rates were age standardized to the 2000 Chinese standard population and Segi's population, which were expressed per 100,000 populations.
RESULTS: After clearance and assessment, data from 30 population-based cancer registries (5 in urban and 25 in rural areas) were included in the analysis. All 30 cancer registries encompassed a total population of 23,421,609 (3,507,984 in urban and 19,913,625 in rural areas), accounting for 21.84% of the provincial population. The proportion of morphological verification (MV%), percentage of cancer cases identified with death certification only (DCO%), and mortality-to-incidence ratio (M/I) were 38.55%, 2.34%, and 0.81, respectively. Approximately 31,639 new cases of liver cancer were diagnosed and 26,057 deaths from liver cancer occurred in Henan in 2015. The crude incidence rate of liver cancer was 27.05/100,000 (36.24/100,000 in men and 17.35/100,000 in women). Age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population and world standard population were 21.10/100,000 and 20.95/100,000, respectively. Liver cancer was more common in men than in women. The incidence rates in urban (26.31/100,000) and rural (27.18/100,000) areas were similar. The crude mortality rate of liver cancer was 21.98/100,000 (29.33/100,000 in males and 14.22/100,000 in females). Age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population and world standard population were 16.93/100,000 and 16.90/100,000, respectively. There was no distinct difference in mortality rates of liver cancer between urban (22.55/100,000) and rural (21.87/100,000) areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Liver cancer has posed a heavy burden on people in Henan province. Comprehensive measures should be conducted to prevent the increase in the incidence of liver cancer.},

  abstract = {Upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGC) screening has been widely implemented in many Asian countries. However, there is little evidence of participation and diagnostic yields in population-based UGC screening in China. The participation rate and detection of upper gastrointestinal lesions in this program were reported and related factors were explored. The analysis was conducted in the context of the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China, which recruited 179 002 eligible participants aged 40-74 years from three cities in Henan province from 2013 to 2017. A total of 43 423 participants were evaluated to be high risk for esophageal cancer or gastric cancer by an established risk score system and were subsequently recommended for endoscopy. Of 43 423 with high risk for UGC, 7996 subjects undertook endoscopy (participation rate of 18.4%). We found that male sex, high level of education, marriage, smoking, current alcohol drinking, lack of physical activity, history of upper gastrointestinal system disease, and family history of UGC were associated with increased participation of endoscopy screening. Overall, 15 UGC (0.19%), 275 squamous epithelial dysplasia (3.44%), and 33 intraepithelial neoplasm (0.41%) cases were detected. Several factors including age, sex, smoking, current alcohol drinking, lack of physical activity, and dietary intake of processed meat were identified to be associated with the presence of upper gastrointestinal lesions. Health promotion campaigns targeting the specific group of individuals identified in our study will be helpful for improvement of the adherence of UGC screening in population-based cancer screening programs. Participant rate and yield of UGC screening will provide important references for evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cancer screening in China.},

  abstract = {Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a growing public health concern for many reasons, and its etiology remains unclear. Due to the similarity of its pathophysiology with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), we evaluated the relationship between published T2DM susceptibility genes and the risk of GDM. A total of 303 SNPs from genes including IRS1, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, GCK, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ11 and the risk of GDM were examined in a nested case-control study with 321 GDM cases and 316 controls. The odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated by unconditional logistical regression as a measure of the associations between genotypes and GDM in additive, recessive, dominant, and codominant models adjusting for maternal age, maternal BMI, parity, and family history of diabetes. At the gene level, CDKAL1 was associated with GDM risk. SNPs in the CDKAL1 gene including rs4712527, rs7748720, rs9350276, and rs6938256 were associated with reduced GDM risk. However, SNPs including rs9295478, rs6935599, and rs7747752 were associated with elevated GDM risk. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, rs9295478 and rs6935599 were still significant across the additive, recessive, and codominant models; rs7748720 and rs6938256 were significant in dominant and codominant models; and rs4712527 was only significant in the codominant model. Our study provides evidence for an association between the CDKAL1 gene and risk of GDM. However, its role in the GDM pathogenesis still needs to be verified by further studies.},

  abstract = {Identification of modifiable dietary factors, which are involved in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), could inform strategies to prevent GDM. Therefore, we examined the dietary nutrient patterns and evaluated their relationship with GDM risk in a Chinese population using a case control study design. A total of 1,464 GDM cases and 8,092 non-GDM controls were included in the final analysis. Dietary intake was assessed using a 33-item food frequency questionnaire, and nutrients were estimated using the Chinese Standard Tables of Food Consumption. Dietary nutrient patterns were identified using factor analysis, and their associations with GDM risk were evaluated using unconditional logistic regression models adjusting for total energy intake, maternal age, high blood pressure, education, maternal body mass index (BMI), parity, and family history of diabetes. A "vitamin" nutrient pattern was characterized as the consumption of diet rich in vitamin A, carotene, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin C, dietary fiber, folate, calcium, and potassium. For every quartile increase in the vitamin factor score during one year prior to conception, the first trimester, and the second trimester of pregnancy, the GDM risk decreased by 9% (OR: 0.91, 95%CI: 0.86-0.96), 9% (OR: 0.91, 95%CI: 0.86-0.96), and 10% (OR: 0.90, 95%CI: 0.85-0.95), respectively. The significant reduced GDM risk was seen in women regardless of age and parity, and slightly stronger effect was found in women whose age ≤ 30 and women who are nulliparous across the three time periods. The significant association was also found in women whose BMI ≤ 24 with similar effect size across the three time periods. Our study suggests that the vitamin nutrient pattern diet is associated with decreased GDM risk. Additional studies are necessary to explore the underlying mechanism of this relationship.},

Methods: We established a screening cohort of 3,997 Chinese women who underwent cervical cytology and HPV genotyping test. Women with ASCUS cytology underwent punch biopsy under colposcopy/endocervical curettage. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of different combination models of HR-HPV genotyping calculated that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or higher (CIN2+) on histology were endpoints. Results: Of the full sample, 393 women had ASCUS. Among ASCUS women with a CIN2 lesion, the prevalence for HPV were 40.0% (type 16), 10.0% (type 18), 0.0% (type 33), 30.0% (type 52), 40.0% (type 58), and 30.0% (other nine types). For ASCUS women with a CIN3 lesion, the prevalence for HPV were 68.4% (type 16), 15.8% (type 18), 10.5% (type 33), 31.6% (type 52), 15.8% (type 58), and 36.8% (other nine types). Combination model including HPV16/18/33/52/58 for predicting CIN2+ lesion in women with ASCUS had relatively higher sensitivity [93.1% (78.0, 98.1)], specificity [75.8% (71.2, 79.9)], PPV [23.5% (16.7, 32.0)], and NPV [99.3% (97.4, 99.8)] than other combination models. Moreover, the referral rate of HPV16/18/33/52/58 (29.3%) was lower than HR-HPV (36.1%). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that specific HR-HPV types HPV16/18/33/52/58 may be an effective strategy in ASCUS triage. This improves the subsequent selection of ASCUS patients.},

Methods Cervical exfoliated cells were collected from 537 eligible women and were used for liquid-based cytology (LBC), p16/Ki-67 dual staining, and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. All women received colposcopy with biopsies taken at abnormal sites. Histopathological diagnoses were used as the gold standard. Results p16/Ki-67 staining had a positivity rate of 43.58% overall; the rate increased significantly with histological severity (p <0.001). The sensitivities of p16/ki-67 for detecting CIN2+ and CIN3+ were 88.10% and 91.30%, respectively. Compared with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV), sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 was lower for detecting CIN2+ (88.10% versus 95.71%), but similar for detecting CIN3+ (91.30% versus 96.27%). Specificities of p16/Ki-67 were 85.02% for detecting CIN2+ and 76.86% for detecting CIN3+, values similar to those for LBC (84.71% for CIN2+, 80.05% for CIN3+) but higher than those for HR-HPV (62.77% for CIN2+, 71.25% for CIN3+). All the tests performed better in women>30 years. With respect to the performance of triage for women with ASC-US, sensitivities of p16/Ki-67 were 86.36% for detecting CIN2+ and 83.33% for detecting CIN3+, values similar to those of HR-HPV. However, specificities of p16/Ki-67 were both higher than those of HR-HPV (85.96% versus 67.54% for CIN2+, 79.84% versus 62.90% for CIN3+). Conclusion P16/Ki-67 dual staining could probably provide an optional method for China's national cervical cancer screening, and could also be considered as an efficient method of triage for managing women with ASC-US.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer in China from 2008 to 2012.
METHODS: Incident and death cases of lung cancer were retrieved from the National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR) database collecting from 135 cancer registries in China during 2008-2012. The crude incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer were calculated by area (urban/rural), region (eastern, middle, western), gender and age group (0, 1-4, 5-9, …, 85+). China census in 2000 and Segi's world population were applied for age-standardized rates. JoinPoint (Version 4.5.0.1) model was used for time trend analysis.
RESULTS: The crude incidence rate of lung cancer was 54.66/100,000 which ranked the first in overall cancers. The age-standardized incidence rates by China population (ASIRC) and by World population (ASIRW) were 35.13/100,000 and 34.86/100,000, respectively. The crude mortality of lung cancer in China was 45.60/100,000 and it was the first cause of cancer-related death in overall cancers. The age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 28.57/100,000 and 28.22/100,000, respectively. Incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer were higher in males than in females and higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Eastern areas had the highest incidence and mortality rates followed by middle and western areas. Incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer retained low level in age groups before 40 years old but increased greatly after and peaked in age group of 80-84. During 2003-2012, the temporal trend of the incidence rate of lung cancer in both sexes in China was general stable (P<0.05). The lung cancer incidence rate increased by 0.71% per year in females (P<0.05) and 2.26% per year in rural areas (P<0.05). The mortality rate of lung cancer decreased slightly annually during 2003-2012 in China (P>0.05). In urban areas, it declined by 0.76% per year (P<0.05), but rose by 2.09% per year (P<0.05) in rural areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate targeted prevention, early detection and treatment programs should be carried out to control the local burden of lung cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The cancer etiology in children and adolescents is largely different with that in adults, and the description in epidemiology still remains deficiency. Therefore, we described the cancer incidence and related epidemiological features in children and adolescents to provide clues for etiological studies.
METHODS: Cancer incidence stratified by age, gender, and areas was calculated using data extracted from population-based cancer registries in Henan Province, China. All cancer among children aged 0-19 years were reclassified according to category criteria of the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, 3rd Edition (ICCC-3). Age-standardized rate (WSR) was calculated using Segi's world standardized population by the direct method, and it was expressed per million person-years.
RESULTS: The crude cancer incidence and mortality were 87.56 and 36.32 per million person-years among children aged 0-19 years, and the WSRs slightly changed compared with crude incidence and mortality, and they were 87.36 and 35.46 per million person-years. Leukemia and central nervous system neoplasms (CNS) were the most common cancer categories both in children aged 0-14 years and in adolescents aged 15-19 years in regardless of gender and areas. Tiny difference of incidence and mortality existed in different age groups across 0-14 years; however, they were higher in adolescents aged 15-19 years than that in children aged 0-14 years. Among children aged 0-19 years, the cancer incidence and mortality were predominant in boys, and the sex ratio was 1.19; however, it was varied by diagnostic categories.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study that described the cancer incidence and mortality among children aged 0-19 in Henan Province, and it would help researchers to understand the burden and epidemiological characteristics of childhood cancer, and hence suggested clues for the etiological studies.},

The exposure status (whether cases and controls had ever attended the screening or not) was acquired by inspecting the well documented screening records. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). There were 253 cases and 759 controls. The reduction in risk of esophageal cancer mortality in individuals who had ever attended screening was 47% (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.37-0.77).

The numbers of new cancer cases and cancer deaths in Henan province with compiled cancer incidence and mortality rates were estimated.
METHODS: In 2015, all registries' data in Henan province were qualified for the national cancer registry annual report in 2012. The pooled data were stratified by area (urban/rural), gender, age group (0, 1.4, 5.9, 10.14, …, 85+) and cancer type. New cancer cases and deaths were estimated using age-specific rates and corresponding population of Henan province in 2012. The Chinese census data in 2000 and Segi's population were applied for age-standardized rates. All the rates were expressed per 100,000 person-years.
RESULTS: Qualified 19 cancer registries (4 urban and 15 rural registries) covered 16,082,688 populations of Henan province in 2012. The percentage of cases with morphologically verified (MV%) and death certificateonly cases (DCO%) were 69.84% and 2.30%, respectively, and the mortality to incidence rate ratio (M/I) was 0.64. It was estimated that there were 248,510 new cancer cases and 158,630 cancer deaths in Henan province in 2012. The incidence rate was 266.17/100,000 (288.61/100,000 in males and 241.86/100,000 in females), the age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 208.95/100,000 and 206.41/100,000 with the cumulative incidence rate (0.74 years old) of 24.30%. The crude incidence rate in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas. However, after adjusted by age, the cancer incidence rate in rural was higher than that in urban areas. The crude mortality of all cancers in Henan province was 169.90/100,000 (201.23/100,000 in males and 135.95/100,000 in females). The age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 131.20/100,000 and 130.80/100,000, respectively. Among the patients aged 0.74 years, the cumulative mortality rate was 15.03%. The crude cancer mortality rate in urban areas was higher than that of rural areas. However, the age-standardized rate in rural areas was higher than that of urban areas. Cancers of lung, stomach, esophagus, liver, female breast, colorectum, cervix, brain, uterus and ovary were the most common cancers, accounting for about 82.80% of all cancer new cases. Lung cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, female breast cancer, brain cancer, leukemia, pancreatic cancer and cervix cancer were the leading causes of cancer deaths, accounting for about 88.50% of all cancer deaths. The burden between urban and rural, males and females were different.
CONCLUSIONS: Registration data of Henan province was qualified to provide basic information on population-based cancer incidence, mortality for cancer prevention and control. The upper digestive tract cancer burden in Henan province, especially for males in rural areas, was higher. The incidence rate of female breast cancer was higher in urban areas. Targeted prevention, early detection and treatment programs should be carried out by health department to control the cancer burden.},

  abstract = {In China, a large burden of gastric cancer has remained, and endoscopic screening was expected to reduce gastric cancer mortality. Therefore, a population-based case-control study was conducted to evaluate the screening effect. The gastric cancer screening program was initiated in Linzhou in the year 2005, and endoscopic examination with indicative biopsy, for residents aged 40-69 years, was used to detect early cancer and precancerous lesion. In this study, cases were defined as individuals who had died of gastric cancer, which were selected from Linzhou Cancer Registry database. Controls were residents (six per case), who had not died of gastric cancer, from the same area as the case, and matched by gender and age (±2 years). The exposure status, whether cases and controls ever attended the screening or not, was acquired by inspecting the well-documented screening records. Conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A total of 313 cases and 1876 controls were included in our analysis. Compared with subjects who never participated in screening, the overall OR for individuals who ever participated in screening was 0.72(95% CI: 0.54-0.97). The OR for lag time 4 years or longer was 0.68(95% CI: 0.47-0.98) and the OR for those who were aged 50-59 years were 0.56 (0.37-0.85). The results suggest a 28% reduction in risk of gastric cancer mortality by endoscopic screening, which may have significant implications for gastric cancer screening in rural areas of China.},

METHODS: At rural areas with high incidence of upper gastrointestinal carcinoma in Henan province total of 88,263 persons with 40 to 69 years old were set to the target population of the screening by the 12 cities and countries and endoscope and pathology diagnosis were performed during 2009-2013. For patients with precancerous lesions, follow-up visits were conducted and defined as follows: once in three years for patients with mild dysplasia, once per year for moderate hyperplasia patients, the patients with severe intraepithelial neoplasia/carcinoma in situ should be treat, at least once per year for those one who didn't under treatment. The result data of screening were summarized and detection rates of esophagus hyperplasia, carcinoma in situ, early and middle-late cancer were calculated, as well as the early diagnosis rate. The result between first round and follow-up screening was compared.
RESULTS: Target population were examined in first round screening. There were 8,434 persons with above mild dysplasia and the detection rate was 9.56%, among them there were 7,224 (8.18%) cases with light-middle hyperplasia, 789 (0.89%) cases with serious dysplasia or cancer in situ, 239 (0.27%) cases with early cancer and 182 (0.21%) cases with middle-late cancer. The sum of serious dysplasia or cancer in situ and early cancer was 1 028 and the early detection rate was 84.96% (1,028/1,210). From 2012 to 2013, the follow-up screening for persons with light-middle hyperplasia which should be followed 4,230 cases, there were 2 853 people to take in screening and compliance was 67.45%. Total of 94 cases were diagnosed with cancer in situ or early cancer. The detection rate and the early detection rate were 3.29% and 100%, respectively. The rates of detection and early detection in phase of follow-up screening were statistically significantly higher than that in first round screening respectively (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: At rural areas of high incidence upper gastrointestinal carcinoma in Henan province, the screening with endoscope had good effect and strengthening the follow-up screening could increase the effect.},

METHODS: Subjects aged 40-69 years in the high risk areas were selected to participate in the endoscopic screening based on the cluster sampling, and screening-positive subjects were sampled for pathological examination. The data of screening were summarized and the detection rates of severe chronic atrophic gastritis, severe intestinal metaplasia, low grade intraepithelial neoplasia, high grade intraepithelial neoplasia, early and middle-late cancer were calculated, and the constituent ratio of early cancer cases was calculated. The detection rates and early diagnosis rates for the first round screening and follow-up screening were compared.
RESULTS: In the 5 years, a total of 88 263 subjects were endoscopically examined in the first round screening and 4 004 subjects were diagnosed with low grade intraepithelial neoplasia or above (the detection rate was 4.54%), in which 3 256 cases were with low grade intraepithelial neoplasia (the detection rate of 3.69%), 366 cases with high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (the rate of 0.41%), 199 cases with early cancer (the rate of 0.22%) and 183 cases with middle-late cancer (the rate of 0.21%). The number of cases of high grade intraepithelial neoplasia and early cancer was 565 and the early diagnosis rate was 75.53%. 1 894 subjects with severe chronic atrophic gastritis, severe intestinal metaplasia and low grade intraepithelial were followed up with a compliance of 66.32%. A total of 45 cases of early cancer were diagnosed, with a detection rate of 2.38% and early diagnosis rate of 100%. The detection rate and early diagnosis rate in the follow-up screening were both statistically significantly higher than that in the first round screening (P<0.01 for both).
CONCLUSION: The efficacy of endoscopic screening for gastric cancer is significant in high risk areas of upper gastrointestinal cancer, and improving the quality of follow-up screening will achieve a better performance of the screening.},

METHODS: A systematic literature search for BMI and incidence risk of lung cancer in the Chinese population, as well as through the reference lists of retrieved articles. The literature databases including Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar. Time range was from the founding of each database to September 2014 and a total of 93 research papers were collected. Meta-analysis was conducted to calculate pooled odds ratio and corresponding 95% CI. Generalized least-squares regression methods were used to make a dose-response meta-analysis between BMI and incidence risk of lung cancer.
RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a number of 2 351 lung cancer cases. Results showed that obesity was inversely associated with lung cancer incidence (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.59-0.79) (heterogeneity test: I² = 0, P = 0.594). The association did not change with stratification by study design, sex, smoking status, BMI measurement method and study population. A linear dose-response association between BMI and risk of lung cancer was visually significant, and lung cancer risk would be reduced 21% for per 5 kg/m² BMI increase (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.71-0.89) (heterogeneity test: q = 22.43, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis indicated that higher BMI was a protective factor against lung cancer, but smoking may play a stronger role as a confounding factor for the most important role with lung cancer incidence.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To descript the incidence and mortality rates of oral cancer among Chinese population in 2011, and provide valuable data for oral cancer prevention and research.
METHODS: Data from 177 population-based cancer registries distributed in 28 provinces were accepted for this study after evaluation based on quality control criteria, covering a total of 175,310,169 populations and accounting for 13.01% of the overall national population in 2011. Incidence and mortality rates were calculated by area, gender and age groups. The numbers of new cases and deaths were estimated using the 5-year age-specific cancer incidence/mortality rates and the corresponding populations. The Chinese population in 2000 and World Segi's population were used for age-standardized rates.
RESULTS: The estimate of new cases diagnosed with oral cancer was 39,450 including 26,160 males and 13,290 females. The overall crude incidence rate for oral cancer was 2.93/100,000. The age-standardized rates by China (ASRCN) population and by World population (ASRwld) were 2.22/100,000 and 2.17/100,000, respectively. Among subjects aged 0-74 years, the cumulative incidence rate was 0.25%. The estimated number of oral cancer deaths of China in 2011 was 16,933, including 11,794 males and 5,139 females. The overall crude mortality rate was 1.26/100,000, accounting for 0.80% of all cancer deaths. The ASRCN and ASRwld for mortality were 0.90/100,000 and 0.89/100,000, respectively. Among subjects aged 0-74 years, the cumulative mortality rate was 0.10%. The incidence and mortality rates of oral cancer were much higher in males and urban areas than in females and rural areas. In addition, the incidence and mortality rates were increased by the raising of ages.
CONCLUSIONS: Results in the study may have important roles for oral cancer prevention and research. Although oral cancer burden of China is not high, we must pay attention to this malignancy as well. In addition, further researches need to be done for primary and secondary prevention research of oral cancer, especially for the high risk population.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Exposure to ambient particulate matter during pregnancy has been suggested as a risk factor for preterm birth. However results from limited epidemiologic studies have been inconclusive. Very few studies have been conducted in areas with high air pollution levels.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the hypothesis that high level exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter no larger than 10μm (PM10) during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm birth.
METHODS: A birth cohort study was carried out between 2010 and 2012 in Lanzhou, China, including 8969 singleton live births with available information on daily PM10 levels from four monitoring stations, individual exposures during pregnancy were calculated using inverse-distance weighting based on both home and work addresses. Unconditional logistic regression modeling was used to examine the associations between PM10 exposure and risk of preterm birth and its clinical subtypes.
RESULTS: Increased risk of very preterm birth was associated with exposure to PM10 during the last two months of pregnancy (OR, 1.07; 95%CI, 1.02-1.13 per 10μg/m(3) increase for last four weeks before delivery; 1.09; 1.02-1.15 for last six weeks before delivery; 1.10; 1.03-1.17 for last eight weeks before delivery). Compared to the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard (150μg/m(3)), higher exposure level (≥150μg/m(3)) of PM10 during entire pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (1.48; 1.22-1.81) and the association was higher for medically indicated preterm birth (1.80, 1.24-2.62) during entire pregnancy and for very preterm during last 6weeks before delivery (2.03, 1.11-3.72).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our study supports the hypothesis that exposure to high levels of ambient PM10 increases the risk of preterm birth. Our study also suggests that the risk may vary by clinical subtypes of preterm birth and exposure time windows. Our findings are relevant for health policy makers from China and other regions with high levels of air pollution to facilitate the efforts of reducing air pollution level in order to protect public health.},

METHODS: On basis of the criteria of data quality from the National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR), data from 6 registries in Henan province were evaluated, covering 6 061 564 people, accounting for 6.45% of the total population in Henan in 2009. There were 3 104 991 people of males, and 2 956 573 people of females. The incidence, mortality, 10 most common cancers, constitution and cumulative rate (0-74 years old) were then calculated. The age-standardized rate was calculated and adjusted by the Chinese standard population in 1982 as well as the Segi's world standard population.
RESULTS: There were 12 091 new diagnosed cancer and 8040 death cases registered in Henan province in 2009. The rate of pathological diagnosis was 68.2% (8246/12 901) and only 1.75% (2116/12 901) had death certificates. The ratio of mortality and incidence was 0.66 (8040/12 091). The incidence rate was 199.47/100 000 (12 091/6 061 564) in total, and it was 216.36/100 000(6718/3 104 991) in males and 181.73/100 000(5373/2 956 573) among females. The standardized incidence by Chinese population was 126.50/100 000 and it was 166.08/100 000 by world's population. The cumulative rate was 19.95% between 0 and 74 years old. The incidence was the highest in Linzhou city, whose standardized incidence was 156.87/100 000 by Chinese population and the incidence was the lowest in Shenqiu city, whose standardized incidence was 104.82/100 000 by Chinese population. The morphology verified cases accounted for 68.2% (8246/12 091), death certification cases only accounted for 1.75% (2116/12 091), and mortality to incidence ratio was 0.66 (8040/12 091). The crude incidence in cancer registration areas of Henan province was 199.47/10 000 (12 091/6 061 564), 216.36/10 000(6718/3 104 991) for males, 181.73/10 000 (5373/2 956 573) for females, age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population and by world standard population were 126.50/10 000 and 166.08/10 000 with cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) of 19.95%. The crude mortality in cancer registration areas of Henan province was 132.64/100 000 (8040/6 061 564), separately 160.58/100 000 (4986/3 104 991) for males and 103.30/10 000 (3054/2 956 573) for females. The age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population and by world's standard population were 78.41/10 000 and 107.49/10 000. The cumulative mortality rate (0-74 age years old) was 12.18%. The mortality rate was the highest in Linzhou city, whose standardized rate was 93.35/100 000 by Chinese population, and the lowest mortality rate was in Yuzhou city, whose standardized rate was 67.95/100 000. The most common cancers were lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, rectum cancer, brain nervous system cancer, colon cancer, cervical cancer and uterus cancer, all of which accounted for 82.23% (9943/12 091) of the registered cancers.Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, rectum cancer, brain nervous system cancer, pancreas cancer, colon cancer and gallbladder carcinoma were the major causes for the death, accounting for 86.30% (6938/8040) of all cancer deaths.

RESULTS: CCR8 was associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; P = 0.012), and CCL13 was associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL; P = 0.003) at gene level. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, none of the genes or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were associated with risk of overall NHL or NHL subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the genes encoding for CC chemokines are not significantly associated with the risk of NHL, and further studies are needed to verify these findings.
IMPACT: Our data indicate that CC chemokine genes were not associated with NHL risk.},
